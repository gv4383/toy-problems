# Toy Problem Repo

Welcome to my toy problem repo!

This repo will be used for storing my solutions to the various toy problems I've encountered.

Within each file contains my own solution to the problem (whether it be optimal or not), maybe another random solution, and finally a time/space complexity for each solution
